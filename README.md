<h1>2048 on JavaScript</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
My first game on JavaScript. The 2048 game is a puzzle created not on the principle of the tag game known to us, but on the principle of connecting identical tiles with numbers to get a tile with the number 2048. The meaning and essence of the game 2048 is to get a tile with the number 2048.
